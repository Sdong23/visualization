# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...
Good Example: COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Over Time (Line Chart)
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations
Classification Reasoning:
This visualization effectively communicates vaccination trends across countries using a line chart, aligning with principles from Cairo‚Äôs The Functional Art and Tufte‚Äôs emphasis on clarity. 
Key strengths include:
Appropriate Chart Type: Line charts excel at showing trends over time, making them ideal for tracking vaccination progress.
Clarity and Simplicity: Clean design with labeled axes, a consistent color scheme, and a legend avoids chartjunk (Tufte). Interactive filters (e.g., country selection) enhance user engagement without clutter.
Accurate Scaling: Linear time axis and normalized percentages prevent distortion, adhering to best practices for truthful representation (Heer & Bostock, 2010).
Gestalt Principles: Proximity (grouped lines) and similarity (color consistency) help viewers distinguish between countries.

Bad Example:  "Learning Challenges" Visualization in the Duolingo Dashboard
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ali15tehrani/viz/duolingo/Duolingo
Classification Reasoning: Table chart.
Poor Color Contrast and Labeling:
Key weaknesses include:
Bars use low-contrast purple with no clear differentiation between challenge types. Axis labels are small and unreadable.
No annotations for colors or explanations of how "challenges" are defined.


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
For good example:
Add annotations (e.g., ‚ÄúFDA approval dates‚Äù) to contextualize spikes/drops.
Improve accessibility with alt text and high-contrast colors for colorblind users.

For bad example: 
Simplify and Standardize Color: Use distinct colors for challenge types.
Add Annotations.



      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
